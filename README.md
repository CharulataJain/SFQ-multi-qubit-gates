# SFQ-multi-qubit-gates
## Towards scalable single-flux quantum multi-qubit gate architectures with superconducting processors

Single flux quantum (SFQ) based gate implementations have received high attention due to their potential for scalability and reduction in hardware overhead. However, thorough characterization and implementation of SFQ-based multi-qubit gate operations, which are key to achieving universal gate operations, are to date, currently unavailable. We present two main results: first, we characterize the dynamics of DC/SFQ conversion to improve benchmark SFQ control for multi-gate operations, and secondly, critically analyze a novel device—a Qubit Energy Tuner (QET)—which generates controlled inductances from DC/SFQ pulses allowing for improved flux-tuning in transmonbased experimental setups. The latter, in conjunction with DC/SFQ pulse converters, enables for precise control over qubit energy levels, unlocking the performance of two-gate operations in SFQ-based apparatuses. We attack approximations made in pre-existing literature by crucially examining the transient behavior found in dynamical simulations of the two studies to evaluate the criteria needed to achieve scalable SFQ architectures. We conclude by evaluating the impact that QET-based quantum devices provide in achieving scalable SFQ-based qubit control.
